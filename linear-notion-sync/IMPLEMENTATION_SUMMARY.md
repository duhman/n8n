## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Notion Database Properties

| Property | Type | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Title | Title | Issue title from Linear |
| Linear ID | Rich Text | Issue identifier (e.g., ELA-123) |
| Linear URL | URL | Direct link to Linear issue |
| Status | Select | Workflow state mapping |
| Assignee | Person | Issue assignee |
| Priority | Select | Priority level mapping |
| Description | Rich Text | Issue description |
| Created Date | Date | Issue creation timestamp |
| Updated Date | Date | Last modification timestamp |
| Cycle | Rich Text | Sprint/cycle information |
| Team | Rich Text | Linear team name |
| External ID | Rich Text | Linear issue ID for sync tracking |
| Last Sync | Date | Conflict prevention timestamp |
| Progress | Formula | Calculated completion percentage |

### Status Mapping
- Backlog ↔ Backlog
- Todo ↔ Todo  
- In Progress ↔ In Progress
- In Review ↔ In Review
- Done ↔ Done
- Cancelled ↔ Canceled

### Priority Mapping
- No priority ↔ 0
- Low ↔ 4
- Medium ↔ 3
- High ↔ 2
- Urgent ↔ 1

## 🚀 Key Features

### Real-time Synchronization
- **Linear webhooks** provide instant updates to Notion
- **Sub-second latency** for most operations
- **Automatic conflict resolution** using timestamps

### Robust Error Handling
- **Intelligent retry logic** for transient failures
- **Error classification** by severity and type
- **Automatic notifications** for critical issues
- **Comprehensive logging** for debugging

### Performance Optimization
- **Batch processing** for bulk operations
- **Rate limit compliance** for both APIs
- **Incremental sync** to minimize data transfer
- **Caching** of frequently accessed data

### Monitoring & Alerting
- **Real-time health monitoring** with hourly checks
- **Daily summary reports** with recommendations
- **Slack/email notifications** for issues
- **Historical tracking** of sync performance

## 🔐 Security & Reliability

### Authentication
- **Secure credential storage** in n8n credential manager
- **API key rotation support** 
- **Webhook signature verification** (optional)

### Data Integrity
- **Deduplication logic** prevents duplicate entries
- **Conflict detection** using timestamps
- **Rollback capability** through backup mechanisms
- **Audit trail** of all sync operations

### Error Recovery
- **Automatic retry** with exponential backoff
- **Manual intervention** triggers for complex issues

- **Graceful degradation** during API outages

## 📊 Monitoring Dashboards

### Health Metrics
- Overall system status (Healthy/Warning/Critical)
- API response times and availability
- Sync success/failure rates
- Error frequency and patterns

### Performance Metrics
- Sync latency and throughput
- API rate limit utilization
- Batch processing efficiency
- Data consistency checks

## 🛠️ Configuration Management

### Central Configuration

## 🔄 Deployment Process

1. **Credential Setup** - Configure API keys in n8n
2. **Database Creation** - Set up Notion database with proper schema
3. **Workflow Import** - Import all 5 workflow files
4. **Configuration** - Update IDs and settings in workflows
5. **Initial Import** - Run one-time data import
6. **Webhook Setup** - Configure Linear webhook URL
7. **Testing** - Verify bidirectional sync functionality
8. **Monitoring** - Enable health checks and alerts
